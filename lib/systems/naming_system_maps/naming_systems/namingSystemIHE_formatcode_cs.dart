This code set additionally includes format codes defined by the HL7 CDA http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=CDA_Format_Codes_for_IHE_XDS. The set was listed in HITSP C80 Table 2-153 Format Code Value Set Definition. The use of the FormatCode specifies the technical format of the document. The FormatCode is a further specialization more detailed than the mime-type. The FormatCode provides sufficient information to allow any potential document consumer to know if it can process and/or display by identifying a document encoding, structure and template. The actual list of codes is intended to be extensible.","uniqueId":[{"type":"uri","value":"http://ihe.net/fhir/ValueSet/IHE.FormatCode.codesystem","preferred":true},{"type":"oid","value":"1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.2.3","preferred":false}]};
