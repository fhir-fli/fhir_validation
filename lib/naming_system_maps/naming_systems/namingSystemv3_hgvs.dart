This coded data type should be able to distinguish expressions in HGVS nomenclature from coded concepts. For example, in the HL7 messages specified according to the HL7 V2 Clinical Genomics Fully LOINC-Qualified Genetic Variation Model, HGVS nomenclature can be used to as the observation values for DNA sequence variations. For example, OBX|1|CWE|48004-6^DNA Sequence Variation^LN||c.1129C>T^^HGVS|\r\n\r\nVersioning information: The HGVS nomenclature for the description of sequence variants was last modified Feb 20, 2008.
