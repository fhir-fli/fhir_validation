The scope includes the test\u0027s purpose, methodology, validity, evidence of the test\u0027s usefulness, and laboratory contacts and credentials. The overarching goal of the GTR is to advance the public health and research into the genetic basis of health and disease.\r\n\r\nEach Test is a specific, orderable test from a particular laboratory, and is assigned a unique GTR accession number. The format is GTR00000001.1, with a leading prefix \"GTR\" followed by 8 digits, a period, then 1 or more digits representing the version. When a laboratory updates a registered test, a new version number is assigned.\r\n\r\nTo find all laboratories in GTR and all registered tests, see here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/all/tests/?term\u003dall%5Bsb%5D","uniqueId":[{"type":"uri","value":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr","preferred":true}]}
