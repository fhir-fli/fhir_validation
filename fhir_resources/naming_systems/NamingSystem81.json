ISCN specifies the nomenclature to describe karyotypes, chromosome abnormalities, in situ hybridization, etc. ISCN provides a list of symbols and abbreviated terms in adjunction with a set of rules, which can be used in the description of chromosomes and chromosome abnormalities, such as p for short arm of chromosome, q for long arm of chromosome, cen for centromere, del for deletion, ish for in situ hybridization, and plus sign (+) for gain, etc.\r\n\r\nA LOINC code is created to represent \"chromosome analysis results in ISCN expression\". In HL7 v2 messages, this LOINC code is used in OBX-3 with a coded result (CWE data type) that will be sent in OBX-5. The value of the coded result is an ISCN expression, and ISCN will be the code system for the coded result.","uniqueId":[{"type":"uri","value":"https://iscn.karger.com","preferred":true},{"type":"oid","value":"2.16.840.1.113883.6.299","preferred":false}]}
